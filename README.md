# webpack-preset-vue

An easy way to get started with VueJS and Webpack.

This package allows you to get started using VueJS with Webpack without worrying about missing a loader needed for your Vue templates. although the list is quite simple, but probably you've missed a dependency or two.

There are already a lot of solutions to this problem, vue-cli and plethora of Yeoman generators, [like my own]() provide boilerplate to get you started quickly. however they are heavily opinionated and that is not a bad thing, in many cases they are "best practice". this package however doesn't care about how you will configure your workflow, it just installs Vue and Webpack workflow dependencies with a simple install command.

## Install

`npm install webpack-preset-vue`

## MIT
